<div class="card"><div class="container"><p>For several years, on and off, I have dabbled in 3D printing. To download and order printed items is something trivial these days, however my interest is in the [relatively simple] 3D modeling formats in use. I started out using SketchUp but eventually found it to be restrictive. The only artifact remaining from those days is this compiled X3G file, ready to print on a FlashForge printer (note: I have the older FlashForge with a frame made out of wood; your results on newer models currently available may vary).</p>

<p><a href="hacks/Ship.x3g">Compiled X3G file for printing a ship on a FlashForge printer</a> (Side note: never trust compiled code. You have been warned. Read <a href="https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/hh/thompson/trust.html">this</a> classic write-up for reference.)</p>

<p>My next step was to generate STL files directly. Building a surface is relatively simple, and you can use the following C code to try that out.</p>

<p><a href="hacks/grid2stl.c">C code to convert a surface height matrix into a STL file for 3D printing</a> (read the code for usage details)</p>

<p>Lately I like describing shapes in the OpenSCAD language which has support for set operations (intersect, subtract, union, etc.) as well as loops etc. Here is the code to generate a brick compatible with the Lego Duplo line. The brick is hollow to allow for some further experimentation that a will not go into right now.</p>

I have been increasingly interested in user behaviors at the intersection of security, wireless computing, and the web. In particular, Android has been an excellent, open platform for experimentation.

Web servers are getting embedded in electronic appliances of all kinds: from home routers, to picture frames and IP phones. Usually the goal is to provide a familiar management interface for the devices; security is typically an afterthought. In recent work we have evaluated the security of web interfaces exposed by a broad range of consumer and enterprise hardware.

<p>Постарах се да напиша накратко впечатленията си от Американската образователна система и от организацията на компютърната индустрия в САЩ (с фокус върху Силициевата Долина).  В процеса на редактирането получих много ценни коментари от приятели, които също като мен са бивши олимпийци. Новогодишен подарък за изгряващите звезди на информатиката в България.</p>
