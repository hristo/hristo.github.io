<p>
<b>Neuroscience Meets Cryptography:</b> <a href="pdfs/usenixsec2012-rubberhose.pdf">USENIX Security 2012 paper</a> on designing security primitives resistant to user coercion (a.k.a. "rubber hose cryptanalysis").
</p>

<p>
<b>Secure Embedded Web Servers:</b> <a href="pdfs/usenix2011-secure-embedded-paper.pdf">USENIX Security 2011 paper</a> about an Android web server designed with security in mind; a continuation of our earlier embedded web interface security project
</p>

<p>
<b>Mobile ASLR:</b> <a href="pdfs/wisec2011-mobileaslr-paper.pdf">WISEC 2011 paper</a> about Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) for mobile devices which requires no kernel changes in the system; in addition, we discuss Crash Stack Analysis: a novel technique for centrally identifying ASLR brute-forcing attacks
</p>

<p>
<b>Cheap Smartphone Unlock Tokens:</b> <a href="pdfs/hotmobile2011-magkey-paper.pdf">HOTMOBILE 2011 paper</a> and <a href="pdfs/hotmobile2011-magkey-slides.pdf">slides</a> about MagKey and MicKey: experimental hardware authentication tokens using a smartphone's compass and microphone as receivers; the main advantages of the design are low cost (less than $1 per token) and low power consumption, as well as broad applicability to existing smartphones
</p>

<p>
<b>Web Security Education:</b> <a href="pdfs/cset2010-webseclab-paper.pdf">CSET 2010 paper</a> about Webseclab, a web security education tool I helped create
</p>

<p>
<b>Password Management:</b> <a href="pdfs/esorics2010-kamouflage.pdf">ESORICS 2010 paper</a> about designing loss-resistant password managers; the high-order bit: it is hard to make security work around irrational human beings; the original publication will appear in the conference proceedings, at www.springerlink.com
</p>

<p>
<b>Insecurity of Embedded Web Interfaces:</b> <a href="pdfs/ccs2009-xcs-paper.pdf">CCS 2009 paper</a> and <a href="pdfs/ccs2009-xcs-slides.pdf">slides</a> about XCS vulnerabilities and SiteFirewall, a Firefox extension that prevents XCS attacks from running to completion (this work was also featured in "Communications of the ACM", August 2010, Vol.53, No.8) (also see this <a href="pdfs/bh2009-emi-slides.pdf">BlackHat USA 2009 briefing</a> on the same topic)
