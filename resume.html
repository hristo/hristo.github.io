Most notably I built up the Product Security function from 1 person to 3 teams, each with a clear charter (and differentiated recruiting pipeline): vehicle security, cloud security, offensive security. As an individual, I also collaborated broadly within Engineering, with IT, as well as with non-technical functions. I also oversaw the 2x growth of the Vehicle Software Infrastructure team into several subteams.</p>

<p><b>2019-2021</b> <b>Senior Staff Software Engineer at Google</b> I was TLM for Serverless Networking in Google Cloud. Managed a team of senior ICs as well as collaborated across Google Cloud (engineering and product) to establish a joint technical roadmap aligned with the product vision.</p>

<p><b>2018-2019</b> <b>Senior Manager, Engineering at Zoox</b> Took on the challenge of building the Rider Platforms organization under Software to address an important area for Zoox. Built the team from scratch, with engineers addressing areas ranging from embedded software (Yocto) to product security (as a horizonal) to rider-facing interfaces (Android and Linux), cellular communications and networking, as well as vehicle SW deployment and mission data ingest.</p>

<p><b>2015-2018</b> <b>CTO at Innit</b> First engineer on the team, hired the whole engineering organization that built software for products ranging from a smart oven, a smart fridge inventory system (embedded + cloud + computer vision), and later enabled the pivot towards an API-only offering.</p>

<p><b>2013-2015</b> <b>CEO at Anfacto</b> Spun off from Motorola, hired a small team to support an existing customer base (Android OS modified for enterprise use) as well as to develop a standalone Android OS distro for single-purpose devices. Managed as a profitable business through final wind-down in 2016.</p>

Responsibilities for the company's NAS product (NAS storage encryption appliance) and key management product (which evolved from an application to a standalone appliance with security and redundancy designed in).</p>

<p><b>2000-2002</b> <b>Software Engineer, Oracle</b> First full-time job out of school, worked on an application server that became the platform for multiple teams to develop apps for their verticals (Warehouse, Inventory, etc.), rendered over Telnet and WAP. Wrote the core event-processing logic and a separate cross-platform load-balancer executable (which still appears to be in use 20+ years later).</p>
